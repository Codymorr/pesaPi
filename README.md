PesaPI 
=======
PesaPI by [pluspeople](https://github.com/pluspeople/pesaPi) API implementation does not support PHP 7 out of the box. I have changed PHP 5 syntax which is no longer supported in PHP 7 with relevant or suitable syntax to make this work. 

The configuration file is not used to connect to database however, the ```credentialsOk()``` function in index.php is used. You might change this as you so desire.

Considerable improvement of the code is warranted however.
